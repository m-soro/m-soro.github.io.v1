      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        I recently successfully completed the intensive four-month full-time
        Software Engineering Certificate Program at Per Scholas, a pivotal
        milestone in my journey towards a career in software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to embarking on this tuition-free program, which I was fortunate
        to be selected for, I dedicated significant time to self-study and
        worked on various personal projects aligned with my interests,
        diligently preparing myself for the challenges ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Balancing a full-time role in a different field, I managed to set aside
        enough resources to cover personal expenses, affording me the
        opportunity to immerse myself in the program.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2023, I had the privilege of attaining United States citizenship, a
        significant milestone since my initial arrival from the Philippines with
        little more than a single contact person for my exchange program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being a first-generation American, I hold immense gratitude for the
        opportunities this country has afforded me. I believe my greatest
        strengths lie in my unwavering perseverance, boundless optimism, and
        unyielding determination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fluent in both English and Tagalog, I currently reside in the vibrant DC
        area with my partner.
