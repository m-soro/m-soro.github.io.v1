      <h1>My Tech Journey</h1>
      <p>
        Hey there, welcome to my side of the web! I recently completed a
        rigorous four-month Software Engineering Certificate Program at Per
        Scholas—a pivotal step in my software development journey. 🎓
      </p>
      <p>
        Before diving into this awesome tuition-free program, I spent
        considerable time self-studying and working on personal projects that
        align with my interests, gearing up for the challenges ahead. 💻📚
      </p>
      <p>
        Balancing a full-time role in a different field, I managed to set aside
        enough resources to cover my expenses, allowing me to fully immerse
        myself in the program. 💼💡
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2023, I finally got my United States citizenship—huge moment
        considering I first landed from the Philippines with just one contact
        person. Being a first-gen American, I'm truly thankful for the
        opportunities this country has opened up for me. 🇵🇭🇺🇸
      </p>
      <p>
        What sets me apart? Definitely my never-give-up attitude, optimism, and
        determination. 💪✨
      </p>
      <p>
        Fluent in both English and Tagalog, I'm soaking up life in the buzzing
        DC area with my amazing partner! 🌟🏙️
