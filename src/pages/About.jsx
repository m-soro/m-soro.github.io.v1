      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        I will soon complete Per Scholas four-month full time Software
        Engineering Track as one important step of my pursuit of a career in
        software development.

      <p>
        Before beginning the tuition-free course which I was selected for, I
        self studied and created projects of interest to me to prepare myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working full-time in another field allowed me to save enough for
        personal expenses to be able to take time off to complete the program.

        I was priviledge to become a United States citizen in 2023, after
        arriving from the Philippines with a little more than some provisions
        and a point of contact for my exchange program.

        As a first generation immigrant, I am grateful for every opportunity
        this country has given me. I like to think that my strengths are my
        perseverance, optimism and determination.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am fluent in English and Tagalog and live in the DC area with my
        partner.
