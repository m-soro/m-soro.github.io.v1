### Mark Soro Software Development Portfolio

This portfolio website is created with React and hosted in github pages.
I wanted a minimal and responsive design.
and more importantly, something that will be low maintenance as much as possible, so I have more time to code =)
This website is using github user api to pull relevant data for my projects.
